# MandelZoom
A fractal screen saver that zooms in on the Mandelbrot set.  
Unlike most fractal screen savers that animate continuously, this one does a periodic 'select and enhance' style of zoom.

## Requirements
* Microsoft Windows (64-bit)  
* .NET Framework 4.5

If your computer doesn't have .NET Framework 4.5 installed (most up-to-date systems already do), you can download and install it from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653).

## Installation
1. Download the screen saver from [here](https://github.com/steveniles/MandelZoom/releases/download/v1.2/mzoom.v1.2.zip) (right click and select "Save link as...")
2. Unzip the file into your Windows folder (i.e. `C:\Windows\`)  
Alternatively, you can unzip the file into any folder, right click on it, and select "Install"

That's it! The screen saver should now show up in Control Panel.
